### 2.0.0

* v2 is a substantial internal rewrite to improve error handling and reporting across the board.

* Thanks go to [oTree](https://github.com/oTree-org) whose detailed feedback and suggestions
  have helped make Ibis v2 significantly more robust than v1.

* The external API is mostly unchanged from v1. The most significant change for template
  authors is that variables that resolve to callables are no longer called automatically --- if you
  want to call a function you need to do so explicitly using brackets, e.g. `{{ some.func() }}`.

* Support for Django-style colon-syntax for function and filter arguments has been removed. Only
  bracket-syntax is now supported.



### 1.0.0

* First stable release.
