"""
Ibis: a lightweight template engine.

How it works: A lexer transforms a template string into an iterable
sequence of tokens. A parser takes this sequence and compiles it
into a tree of nodes. Each node has a .render() method which takes a context
object and returns a string. The entire compiled node tree can be
rendered by calling .render() on the root node.

Compiling and rendering the node tree are two distinct processes. Once
the template has been compiled it can be cached and rendered multiple times
with different context objects.

The Template class acts as the public interface to the template engine.
This is the only class the end-user needs to interact with directly.

A Template object is initialized with a template string. It compiles the
string and stores the resulting node tree for future rendering. Calling the
template object's .render() method with a dictionary of key-value pairs or
a set of keyword arguments renders the template and returns the result as a
string.

Example:

    >>> template = Template('{{foo}} and {{bar}}')

    >>> template.render(foo='ham', bar='eggs')
    'ham and eggs'

    >>> template.render({'foo': 1, 'bar': 2})
    '1 and 2'
